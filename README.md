# BOM

- M3x5x4 heatset inserts
- M3x6 button head screws
- Self-tapping M2x10 screws for Trident/v2.4r2 PCB DIN clip mounts
- <a href="https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Trident/blob/main/STLs/ElectronicsBay/pcb_din_clip_v2_x5.stl"> Voron PCB DIN clip</a>
- SSR DIN Rail mount (can be found at various Voron vendors like Fabreeko, KB-3D, West3D, etc.)

# BTT SKR Mini E3 DIN Mount

Modified standard SKR Mini E3 from <a href="https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-0"> Voron V0 repo</a> to use current Trident and v2.4r2 PCB DIN clips and M3 heatset inserts. 

# BTT SKR Mini E3 SSR DIN Mount

Modified SKR Mini E3 mount from V0 to use with a SSR DIN mount. I recommend this mount instead of the regular DIN rail mount if you are mounting the MCU on a vertical DIN rail.

# Mellow Fly-UTOC DIN Mount

Based on timmit99's <a href="https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Hardware/tree/master/Klipper_Expander"> Klipper_Expander mount</a>. Uses Trident/v2.4 PCB DIN rail clip and M3 inserts.

# Klipper_Expander Mount

Modified from on timmit99's original Klipper_Expander mount. Changes include mounting holes to fit Trident and v2.4r2 PCB DIN clips. Also has been modified to use standard voron M3 heatset inserts.

# Raspberry Pi DIN SSR Mount

Adapted from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5222787. Recommended if mounting the RPi on a vertical DIN rail. Uses M3 heatset inserts. 

WARNING: Raspberry Pi's typically use M2.5 screws for mounting. I carefully enlarged the mounting holes on my Rpi with an M3 reamer. A 1/8 inch drill bit can be used, however I recommend getting an M3 reamer for the job.
